## challenge 5 

# Overview Analysis
The purpose of this challenge was to compile and organize data collected from a rideshare service across various cities and their city type. Thereby determinig the efficacy of the rideshare company in each city type, and decide what, if any, change should be implimented to improve the company.

# Results
Deliverable 1 showed that urban cities had the most rides completed and generated the most overall income, however the more rural cities had higher fares per ride and per driver, thereby generating the most income per ride.

Deliverable 2 showed that by creating a pivot table and modifying the index from "type" to "date" we could use the loc method to isolate data just from 2019-01-01 to 2019-04-29. Then when we created our line graph based on the information from that table, we could have it display the dates we were looking to analyze instead of having to sort through excess data.

# Summary
If I was advising the CEO of this company, I would definitely reccomend focusing on increasing marketing in rural areas, as prices per ride there are much higher liekly due to a smaller demand and things being more vastly seperated and rides being longer. Increasing this market even by a small margin could really improve the total profit seen from those tyoes of cities. Constrastly, I would reccomend raising fares slighly in urbad cities, as the demand seems to be quite high however the length of rides are likely much shorter as urban cities tend to be more compact. Increasing prices by a small margin should go relatively unnoticed to the passengers going such small distances but will quickly add up in terms of companyb revenue.
